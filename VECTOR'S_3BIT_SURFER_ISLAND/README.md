## Vector's 3-Bit Surfer Island

You control a surfer navigating through procedurally generated tracks by Vector filled with walls, blocks, and wires. With 84 positions to traverse and only specific actions available, every move counts:

- TRACK_UP/TRACK_DOWN: Switch lanes to avoid obstacles
- JUMP: Leap over blocks when you can't go around
- DODGE: Slide under wires when there's no other way
- NONE: Stay in your lane and hope for the best
